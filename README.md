# JPMN Manager

JPMN Manager is a simple Anki add-on that provides a user interface for installing and updating
[jp-mining-note](https://github.com/Aquafina-water-bottle/jp-mining-note/).

> **Note**: If you are familiar with basic command line,
> it is recommended to use the
> [python scripts](https://github.com/Aquafina-water-bottle/jp-mining-note/tree/master/tools)
> directly instead of using this add-on.

## Download

> **Warning**:
>
> CURRENTLY WIP. DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS ADDON UNLESS YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING.

There are two versions of JPMN Manager you can download.

1. Stable releases only: `TODO`

    This is the standard version, and the recommended version if you don't know what version to use.

1. With prereleases: `1732829476` ([AnkiWeb link](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1732829476))

    This is the version you want to use if you want to test releases before its
    official stable release, and have the latest features possible.
    However, **expect more bugs**.

    If you are looking to help out with jp-mining-note,
    I recommend using this version, and
    [reporting any issues you find](https://aquafina-water-bottle.github.io/jp-mining-note/faq/#contact-info).
    Any and all help is greatly appreciated!


To download JPMN Manager:

* Within Anki, navigate to `Tools` →  `Add-ons` →  `Get Add-ons...`
* Copy and paste the desired numeric code into the window.

## What this add-on does NOT do
The scope of this add-on is very small, so many features are not supported.

* This add-on does NOT (and will never) automatically update your note when there are new updates.
    You will have to manually navigate to "Update jp-mining-note" to update your note.
* This add-on does NOT notify the user when there are new updates.
* You CANNOT build the note with the add-on, because
    building the note requires various external dependencies that does not come
    with Anki.
