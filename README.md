# jpmn-manager

jpmn-manager is a simple Anki add-on that provides a user interface for certain scripts found in
[jp-mining-note/tools](https://github.com/Aquafina-water-bottle/jp-mining-note/tree/master/tools).
In particular, thsi add-on allows you install and update the note within Anki,
without having to manually install Python and run the scripts on command line.

## Usage
TODO link to documentation

## What this add-on does NOT do
This add-on does NOT notifying the user when there are new updates.
Additionally, you cannot build the note with the add-on, because
building the note requires various external dependencies that does not come
with Anki.

In general, if you're familiar with basic command line,
it is recommended to use the scripts directly instead of using this add-on.
