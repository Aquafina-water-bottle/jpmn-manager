# JPMN Manager

JPMN Manager is a simple Anki add-on that provides a user interface for installing and updating
[jp-mining-note](https://github.com/Aquafina-water-bottle/jp-mining-note/).

## Usage
TODO link to documentation

## What this add-on does NOT do
The scope of this add-on is very small.
This add-on does NOT notify the user when there are new updates.
Additionally, you cannot build the note with the add-on, because
building the note requires various external dependencies that does not come
with Anki.

In general, if you're familiar with basic command line,
it is recommended to use the scripts directly instead of using this add-on.
