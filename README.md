# JPMN Manager

JPMN Manager is a simple Anki add-on that provides a user interface for installing and updating
[jp-mining-note](https://github.com/Aquafina-water-bottle/jp-mining-note/).

> **Note**: If you are familiar with basic command line,
> it is recommended to use the
> [python scripts](https://github.com/Aquafina-water-bottle/jp-mining-note/tree/master/tools)
> directly instead of using this add-on.

## Usage
TODO link to documentation

## What this add-on does NOT do
The scope of this add-on is very small, so many features are not supported.

* This add-on does NOT (and will never) automatically update your note when there are new updates.
    You will have to manually navigate to "Update jp-mining-note" to update your note.
* This add-on does NOT notify the user when there are new updates.
* You CANNOT build the note with the add-on, because
    building the note requires various external dependencies that does not come
    with Anki.

## TODO
- upload to ankiweb
